# TASK: Reverse-engineering analysis + foundation

Rules, commands and constraints are in CLAUDE.md. Follow them throughout.

## Goal
Run a reverse-engineering analysis (REA) of Canopy and Atoll, turn it into a feature matrix and architecture plan for DropNotch, then scaffold the foundation. DropNotch must be original code that Shash owns.

## Phase 1: Analysis (done, 2026-10-24)
Canopy's public pages and Atoll's features were analysed, and the decisions D1–D10 were approved by Shash. Outputs: docs/FEATURE_MATRIX.md, docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, docs/RISKS.md, docs/DECISIONS.md and docs/research/.

## Phase 2: Foundation (planned; needs Shash's approval before any app code)

Decision numbers (D1–D10) refer to docs/DECISIONS.md. Start with the `planner` agent and send its plan to Shash. Steps a and b are verification and project setup; step a ends with a report to Shash, and no module code is built until Shash has read it.

a. **Step 0: verify before building.** Report to Shash before continuing.
   - **Clipboard warning probe (D7).** Build a throwaway probe in a scratch folder outside DropNotch/. It is not committed. It reads `NSPasteboard.general` in the background when `changeCount` changes. Record: whether macOS shows a privacy alert or prompt on the current macOS version; what triggers it; whether reading only `changeCount` and `types` avoids it. Report the result to Shash before the Clipboard module is built.
   - **Apple API claims.** Check every [I]-tagged Apple API claim in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, docs/RISKS.md and docs/FEATURE_MATRIX.md against developer.apple.com. Re-tag each as [V: doc URL], or correct it. Anything that can only be confirmed on a device goes on the manual-check list in step i.

b. **project.yml and dependencies.** Done on branch `feat/project-config` (commit 7b083c3) unless marked otherwise.
   - `LSUIElement` = YES (Info.plist properties). Done.
   - `ENABLE_HARDENED_RUNTIME` on; no App Sandbox (D4). Done.
   - Hardened runtime applies to Release only for now (D11); test Automation prompts with a Release build.
   - Entitlements file, declared in project.yml, containing `com.apple.security.automation.apple-events`. Done.
   - `NSAppleEventsUsageDescription` in Info.plist properties. Done.
   - `KeyboardShortcuts` package pinned with `exactVersion:` (3.1.0, as recorded in DECISIONS.md D10a). Done. The licence (MIT) is recorded in D10a. `dependency-manager` verified the resolved pin, licence and Swift modes (D10a).
   - `fileGroups` lists CLAUDE.md, TASK.md and docs as reference-only files in Xcode's navigator (D12). Done.
   - Run `xcodegen generate`. Done.

c. **Menu-bar item and launch at login.** `NSStatusItem` with Settings and Quit. Launch at login through `SMAppService`.

d. **NotchPanel.**
   - Borderless, non-activating `NSPanel` above the menu bar. Joins all Spaces and full-screen apps.
   - Closed state sized exactly to the notch (D5). Pill on displays without a notch.
   - One display only (D9).
   - Repositions on screen-parameter changes, debounced 200 ms.
   - Displays are keyed by `CGDirectDisplayID`, never by name.

e. **Hover state machine.** Closed → peek → open. 0.3 s open delay, 0.1 s exit debounce, spring animations. Uses an AppKit tracking area. No polling loop.

f. **Module protocol, registry and stub module.**
   - `NotchModule` protocol and `ModuleRegistry` (ARCHITECTURE.md §3).
   - Fixed layout slots (D8).
   - One stub Now Playing module behind a `NowPlayingSource` protocol (D2), rendering a placeholder. No real sources yet.

g. **Unit tests via `test-writer`.**
   - Notch geometry (the pure `NotchGeometry` function, ARCHITECTURE.md §7).
   - Hover state machine (the pure transition function).
   - Registry start and stop on enable and disable.

h. **Build and test.** Run `xcodegen generate`, then `xcodebuild -scheme DropNotch -destination 'platform=macOS' build test`. Show the real output. Nothing is claimed as passing without it.

i. **Manual checks on a real notched Mac.** These cannot run in CI.
   - Hover at the top pixel row.
   - Clicks next to the closed notch reach the apps underneath.
   - Panel behaviour over full-screen apps and across Spaces.
   - Reposition when an external display is connected or removed.
   - Every item from step a that could only be confirmed on a device, including:
     - Automation prompts (Release build, D11): does macOS show one prompt per target app, on the first Apple Event? Not stated in Apple docs; confirm on device.
     - Privacy grants after re-signing: does an ad-hoc rebuild re-prompt or lose grants? Not stated in Apple docs; confirm on device.
     - Clipboard (D7): results of the step a probe; also whether Always Deny leaves `changeCount` working.
     - Folder prompts: does an unsandboxed build get the Desktop, Documents or Downloads prompt on first access?
     - Downloaded DMG: is it quarantined and checked like the app?
     - Audio-tap permission prompt from a Release build (v0.2 waveform).
     - Screen capture: are our windows excluded via ScreenCaptureKit filters (Apple says not to rely on `sharingType`)?

j. **Review and records.**
   - `code-reviewer`, `performance-optimizer` and `accessibility-auditor` (the notch UI changed).
   - `security-auditor`, because the entitlements changed in step b (CLAUDE.md).
   - Update docs/DECISIONS.md and docs/ARCHITECTURE.md.

## Out of scope for Phase 2
Now Playing real sources, file tray, clipboard, and notes modules (Phase 3). MediaRemote (v0.2). Lock screen (beyond v0.2). Sparkle.
